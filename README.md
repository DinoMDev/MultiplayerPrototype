## 🏗️ Development Workflow

This project enforces a **professional workflow** using branch naming conventions and CI:

1. Create feature branches using:
   - `feat/<feature-name>`
   - `fix/<bug-name>`
   - `chore/<task>`
   - `refactor/<scope>`
2. Push → CI validates the branch & commits
3. Open Pull Request → must pass checks before merging into `dev` or `main`

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open project in Unity  
3. Run the scene `Assets/...` (update once defined)  
4. Play and test!
